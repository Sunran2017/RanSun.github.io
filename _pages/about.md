I am a Ph.D. candidate studying agricultural and resource economics at the University of Saskatchewan. During my Ph.D. program, I am working on the socio-economic assessment of beneficial water management practices and their policy-induced adoption. A comprehensive socio-economic assessment toolbox is used in this study based on a complex socio-ecological system framework, including life-cycle assessment, multi-criteria analysis, and agent-based computation modeling (artificial society). My research interest is in interdisciplinary computational modeling for sustainable agriculture. Also, I would love to explore the application of data science (e.g. big data and machine learning) in the field of applied economics. 


I obtained my bachelor's and master's degree in Business Administration in China. My chance with agricultural and resource economics started from participating in the Chinese eco-project of converting farmland back to forests as a research assistant when I was at my graduate school in Northwest Agricultural and Forestry University of China. To survey those peasants, I interviewed and observed people living abject poverty in arid North-western China but still striving to work hard with optimistic spirits. I was so touched by the situation and felt motivated to keep on studying agricultural economics. I think that was the time for me to be bounded with agriculture and rural development. 

I really agree with the opinion that agricultural economics is like the engineering in economics, which means it should bring new technology in supporting decision-making. I would like to contribute more research for investigating large-scale interactions within socio-ecological systems applying data science.
