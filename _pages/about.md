I am a Ph.D. candidate studying agricultural and resource economics at the University of Saskatchewan. During my Ph.D. program, I am working on the socio-economic assessment of beneficial water management practices and their policy-induced adoption. A comprehensive socio-economic assessment toolbox is used in this study based on a complex socio-ecological system framework, including life-cycle assessment, multi-criteria analysis, and agent-based computation modeling (artificial society). My research interest is in interdisciplinary computational modeling for sustainable agriculture.

I obtained my bachelor's and master's degree in China in Business Administration. My chance with agricultural and resource economics started from participating in the Chinese eco-project of converting farmland back to forests as a research assistant when I was at my graduate school in Northwest Agricultural and forestry university of China. To survey those peasants, I interviewed and observed people living abject poverty in arid North-western China but still striving to work hard with optimistic spirits. I was so touched by the situation and felt motivated to keep on studying agricultural economics. I think that was the time for me to be bounded with agriculture and rural development. So I choose an interdisciplinary topic for my master dissertation, which is about the effects of R&D on the energy efficiency of agricultural enterprises.
